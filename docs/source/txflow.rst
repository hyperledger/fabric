Transaction Flow
================

This document outlines the transactional mechanics that take place during a standard asset
exchange.  The scenario includes two clients, A and B, who are buying and selling
radishes.  They each have a peer on the network through which they send their 
transactions and interact with the ledger.

**Assumptions**

This flow assumes that a channel is set up and running.  The application user
has registered and enrolled with the organization’s certificate authority (CA)
and received back necessary cryptographic material, which is used to authenticate
to the network.

The chaincode (containing a set of key value pairs representing the initial
state of the radish market) is installed on the peers and instantiated on the
channel.  The chaincode contains logic defining a set of transaction
instructions and the agreed upon price for a radish. An endorsement policy has
also been set for this chaincode, stating that both ``peerA`` and ``peerB`` must endorse
any transaction.

1. **Client A initiates a transaction**

What's happening? - Client A is sending a request to purchase radishes.  The
request targets ``peerA`` and ``peerB``, who are respectively representative of 
Client A and Client B. The endorsement policy states that both peers must endorse 
any transaction, therefore the request goes to ``peerA`` and ``peerB``.

Next, the transaction proposal is constructed.  An application leveraging a supported
SDK (node, java, python) utilizes one of the available API's which generates a
transaction proposal.  The proposal is a request to invoke a chaincode function
so that data can be read and/or written to the ledger (i.e. write new key value
pairs for the assets).  The SDK serves as a shim to package the transaction proposal 
into the properly architected format (protocol buffer over gRPC) and takes the user’s 
cryptographic credentials to produce a unique signature for this transaction proposal.

2. **Endorsing peers verify signature & execute the transaction**

The endorsing peers verify the signature (using MSP) and determine if the
submitter is properly authorized to perform the proposed operation (using the
channel's ACL). The endorsing peers take the transaction proposal arguments as
inputs and execute them against the current state database to produce transaction
results including a response value, read set, and write set.  No updates are
made to the ledger at this point. The set of these values, along with the
endorsing peer’s signature and a YES/NO endorsement statement is passed back as
a “proposal response” to the SDK which parses the payload for the application to
consume.

*{The MSP is a local process running on the peers which allows them to verify
transaction requests arriving from clients and to sign transaction results(endorsements).
The ACL (Access Control List) is defined at channel creation time, and determines
which peers and end users are permitted to perform certain actions.}*

3. **Proposal responses are inspected**

The application verifies the endorsing peer signatures and compares the proposal
responses (link to glossary term which will contain a representation of the payload)
to determine if the proposal responses are the same and if the specified endorsement
policy has been fulfilled (i.e. did peerA and peerB both endorse).  The architecture
is such that even if an application chooses not to inspect responses or otherwise
forwards an unendorsed transaction, the policy will still be enforced by peers
and upheld at the commit validation phase.

4. **Client assembles endorsements into a transaction**

The application “broadcasts” the transaction proposal and response within a
“transaction message” to the Ordering Service. The transaction will contain the
read/write sets, the endorsing peers signatures and the Channel ID.  The
Ordering Service does not read the transaction details, it simply receives
transactions from all channels in the network, orders them chronologically by
channel, and creates blocks of transactions per channel.

5. **Transaction is validated and committed**

The blocks of transactions are “delivered” to all peers on the channel.  The
transactions within the block are validated to ensure endorsement policy is
fulfilled and to ensure that there have been no changes to ledger state for read
set variables since the read set was generated by the transaction execution.
Transactions in the block are tagged as being valid or invalid.

6. **Ledger updated**

Each peer appends the block to the channel’s chain, and for each valid transaction
the write sets are committed to current state database. An event is emitted, to
notify the client application that the transaction (invocation) has been
immutably appended to the chain, as well as notification of whether the
transaction was validated or invalidated.

**Note**: See the :ref:`swimlane` diagram to better understand the server side flow and the 
protobuffers.
