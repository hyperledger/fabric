Tutorials
=========

We offer tutorials to get you started with Hyperledger Fabric.
The first is oriented to the Hyperledger Fabric **application developer**,
:doc:`write_first_app`. It takes you through the process of writing your first
blockchain application for Hyperledger Fabric using the Hyperledger Fabric
`Node SDK <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node>`_. For a more developer
focused experience for developing apps, check out :doc:`developapps/developing_applications`.

We also have a tutorial oriented towards the Hyperledger Fabric network
operators, :doc:`build_network`. This one walks you through the process of
establishing a blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric and provides
a basic sample application to test it out.

There are two tutorials for updating a channel: :doc:`config_update` and
:doc:`updating_capabilities`, while :doc:`upgrading_your_components` shows how
to upgrade components like peers, ordering nodes, SDKs, and more.

Finally, we offer two chaincode tutorials. One oriented to developers,
:doc:`chaincode4ade`, and the other oriented to operators, :doc:`chaincode4noah`.

.. note:: If you have questions not addressed by this documentation, or run into
          issues with any of the tutorials, please visit the :doc:`questions`
          page for some tips on where to find additional help.
