# Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to run a Docker-based Fabric test network on your local machine.

## Mac

### Homebrew

For macOS, we recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to manage the prereqs.

```shell
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
$ brew --version
Homebrew 2.5.2
```

The Xcode command line tools will be installed as part of the Homebrew installation.
Once Homebrew is ready, installing the necessary prerequisites is very easy:

### Git

Install the latest version of [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if it is not already installed.

```shell
$ brew install git
$ git --version
git version 2.23.0
```

### cURL

Install the latest version of [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) if it is not already installed.

```shell
$ brew install curl
$ curl --version
curl 7.64.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin19.0) libcurl/7.64.1 (SecureTransport) LibreSSL/2.8.3 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.39.2
Release-Date: 2019-03-27
```

### Docker

Install the latest version of [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if it is not already installed.
Since Docker Desktop is a UI application on Mac, use `cask` to install it.

Homebrew v2.x:

```shell
$ brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" docker
```

Homebrew v3.x:

```shell
$ brew install --cask --appdir="/Applications" docker
```

Docker Desktop must be launched to complete the installation so be sure to open the application after installing it:

```shell
$ open /Applications/Docker.app
```

Once installed, confirm the latest versions of both `docker` and `docker-compose` executables were installed.

```shell
$ docker --version
Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.27.2, build 18f557f9
```

> **Note:** Some users have reported errors while running Fabric-Samples with the Docker Desktop `gRPC FUSE for file sharing` option checked.
> Please uncheck this option in your Docker Preferences to continue using `osxfs for file sharing`.

### Go

Optional: Install the latest Fabric supported version of [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) if it is not already
installed (only required if you will be writing Go chaincode or SDK applications).

```shell
$ brew install go@1.23.5
$ go version
go1.23.5 darwin/amd64
```

### JQ

Optional: Install the latest version of [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) if it is not already installed
(only required for the tutorials related to channel configuration transactions).

```shell
$ brew install jq
$ jq --version
jq-1.6
```

## **Linux**

### Git

Install the latest version of [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if it is not already installed.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

### cURL

Install the latest version of [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) if it is not already installed.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install curl
```

### Docker

Install the latest version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if it is not already installed.Â 

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install docker-compose
```

Once installed, confirm that the latest versions of both Docker and Docker Compose executables were installed.

```shell
$ docker --version
Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.27.2, build 18f557f9
```

Make sure the Docker daemon is running.

```shell
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Optional: If you want the Docker daemon to start when the system starts, use the following:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Add your user to the Docker group.

```shell
sudo usermod -a -G docker <username>
```

### Go

Optional: Install the latest version of [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) if it is not already installed
(only required if you will be writing Go chaincode or SDK applications).

### JQ

Optional: Install the latest version of [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) if it is not already installed
(only required for the tutorials related to channel configuration transactions).

## **Windows**

### Docker

Install the latest version of [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if it is not already installed.

### WSL2

Both the Fabric documentation and Fabric samples rely heavily on a `bash` environment. The recommended
path is to use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2) to provide a native Linux environment and then you can follow the Linux prerequisites section (excluding the Linux Docker prerequisite as you already have Docker Desktop) and install them into your WSL2 linux distribution.

WSL2 may not be installed by default; you can check and install WSL2 by going into "Programs and Features", clicking on "Turn Windows features on or off" and ensuring that both "Windows Subsystem For Linux" and "Virtual Machine Platform" are selected.

Next you will need to install a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu-22.04 and make sure it's set to using version 2 of WSL. Refer to [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for more information.

Finally, you need to ensure Docker Desktop has integration enabled for your distribution so it can interact with Docker elements, such as a bash command window. To do this, open the Docker Desktop gui and go into settings, select `Resources` and them `WSL Integration` and ensure the checkbox for enable integration is checked. You should then see your WSL2 linux distribution listed (if you don't then it is probably because it is still a WSL1 distribution and needs to be converted to WSL2) and you can then toggle the switch to enable integration for that distro. Refer to [Docker Desktop WSL2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) for more information

### Microsoft VS Code (Optional)

Microsoft VS Code provides an IDE that has tight integration with WSL2 Linux Distributions. Search the Microsoft Marketplace in VS Code for the Remote Development extension pack for more information. This pack includes, among other things, the `Remote - WSL extension` and the `Remote - Containers` extension.

### Git For Windows (Optional)

Although not required, if you do decide to install Git on Windows and manage the Fabric repositories natively (as opposed to within WSL2 and its Git installation), then make sure you configure Git as follows:

Update the following `git` configurations:
```shell
git config --global core.autocrlf false
git config --global core.longpaths true
```

You can check the setting of these parameters with the following commands:
```shell
git config --get core.autocrlf
git config --get core.longpaths
```
These output from these commands should be false and true respectively.

## **Notes**

- These prerequisites are recommended for Fabric users. If you are a Fabric developer, please refer to the instructions for [Setting up the development environment](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-setup/devenv.html).
