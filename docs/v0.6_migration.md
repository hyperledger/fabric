This document serves as an overview of the new features present in fabric
v0.6.1-preview release, and outlines the changes you will need to make to
successfully migrate code originally written for the v0.5-developer-preview
release that you now wish to run on fabric v0.6.1-preview.

## Migrating chaincode to fabric v0.6.1-preview

__1.__ The chaincode shim interface changes for compatibility with the latest
Hyperledger shim:

The chaincode interface has changed from `shim.ChaincodeStub` to
`shim.ChaincodeStubInterface`. See the
[interfaces.go](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v0.6/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go) file for the shim
source code. The following code snippet from line 74 of chaincode_example02 will
highlight this alteration.

This change applies to all transaction types:  Deploy, Invoke, and Query.

```go

func (t *SimpleChaincode) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStub, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {

func (t *SimpleChaincode) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
```

__2.__ Chaincode calling chaincode is included in the shim package.

There are two functions available - **InvokeChaincode** and **QueryChaincode**.
First, these functions no longer accept the function name as a parameter;
instead the function must be passed in as an argument.  Second, the arguments
are passed in as a byte array, not a string.  A utility is provided to convert
your strings to a byte array.

The following code snippets from chaincode_example04 demonstrate the difference.
Make note of `f`, representing the function invoke.  It is removed from the
**InvokeChaincode** parameters, and instead passed as an argument to the **invokeArgs**
element.  The arguments are then converted to a byte array before being passed
to **InvokeChaincode**.  This change is not optional and must be implemented in
your code.

```go
// fabric v0.5-developer-preview
f := "invoke"
invokeArgs := []string{"a", "b", "10"}
response, err := stub.InvokeChaincode(chainCodeToCall, f, invokeArgs)
```

```go
// fabric v0.6.1-preview code
f := "invoke"
// function is removed from InvokeChaincode, now passed as an argument within
// invokeArgs.  invokeArgs is converted to byte array and then passed along.
invokeArgs := util.ToChaincodeArgs(f, "a", "b", "10")
response, err := stub.InvokeChaincode(chainCodeToCall, invokeArgs)
```

__3.__ Chaincode APIs have changed when constructing REST API payloads and CLI
commands.

The function can now be passed within the "args" element as the
first argument. The following code snippets will demonstrate the changes to a
basic chaincode invoking transaction from the CLI and through the REST API.

```
peer chaincode invoke -1 golang -n mycc -c '{"Function": "invoke", "Args": ["a", "b", "10"]}'

peer chaincode invoke -1 golang -n mycc -c '{"Args": ["invoke", "a", "b", "10"]}'
```

```JSON
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "invoke",
  "params": {
      "type": 1,
      "chaincodeID":{
          "name":"mycc"
      },
      "ctorMsg": {
         "function":"invoke",
         "args":["a", "b", "10"]
      }
  },
  "id": 3
}
```

```JSON
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "invoke",
  "params": {
      "type": 1,
      "chaincodeID":{
          "name":"mycc"
      },
      "ctorMsg": {
         "args":["invoke", "a", "b", "10"]
      }
  },
  "id": 3
}
```

**Note**:  REST API and CLI developed in fabric v0.5-developer-preview will work
with fabric v0.6.1-preview.  However, when using the Java SDK you must implement
the new format, where the function is passed within the "args" element.

## New Features

__1.__ Custom Events & Event handler:

The fabric now has the ability to create custom events and emit this information
to a client-side node application leveraging the hfc SDK.  This is done by
implementing the EventHub Service in your node program.  The EventHub Service
listens for events.

You can customize the [eventsender.go](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v0.6/examples/chaincode/go/eventsender/eventsender.go) code to determine which events you want
sent. In the example, only the invoke transaction type is coded to send outgoing
events.  See the following code snippet in eventsender.go which demonstrates
invocations being broadcast by the event sender:

```go
func (t *EventSender) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
	b, err := stub.GetState("noevents")
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.New("Failed to get state")
	}
  // define the construct for the event
	noevts, _ := strconv.Atoi(string(b))

	tosend := "Event " + string(b)
	for _, s := range args {
		tosend = tosend + "," + s
	}
  // create the event based on the construct
	err = stub.PutState("noevents", []byte(strconv.Itoa(noevts+1)))
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
  // pass the event along for Event Listener service
	err = stub.SetEvent("evtsender", []byte(tosend))
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return nil, nil
}
```

Enable the event service in your node program with the following steps:

```go
// set the port where the event service will listen
chain.eventHubConnect("localhost:7053");

// Get the eventHub service associated with the chain
var eventHub = chain.getEventHub();

// Register on a specific chaincode for a specific event - syntax example only
eventHub.registerChaincodeEvent(<chaincode ID>, <event name>, <callback>);
// actual code example
var registrationId = eh.registerChaincodeEvent("b16cec7aa4466f57dd18f3c159b85d2962e741824c702136fdfcf616addcec01", "evtsender", function(event) {
        console.log(util.format("Custom event received, payload: %j\n", event.payload.toString()));
});

//Unregister events or a specific chaincode
eventHub.unregisterChaincodeEvent(registrationID);

// disconnect when done listening for events
process.on('exit', function() {
    chain.eventHubDisconnect();
});
```

for the application source code and deeper documentation.

__2.__ Java chaincode shim - new shim library to support java chaincode interacting
with Hyperledger fabric.  See the [java shim](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/v0.6/core/chaincode/shim/java)
library for the source code.

__3.__ Ability to call chaincode using a 64encoded string.  A custom UnmarshalJSON
method for ChaincodeInput allows for string-based REST/JSON input, which is then
converted to []byte-based.  This allows browsers to pass in string or binary
arguments to the application driving the chaincode.

__4.__ Docker client upgrade to [Docker 1.12](https://blog.docker.com/2016/07/docker-built-in-orchestration-ready-for-production-docker-1-12-goes-ga/)

__5.__ `fabric-peer` and `fabric-membersrvc` images for multiple platforms are available on [Hyperledger Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/).  The images are part of the continuous integration process and built with every new code change.

__6.__ New warnings for chaincode development.  The following practices can lead to
malfunctioning and/or non-deterministic chaincode and should be avoided:

- Iterating using GetRows
- Using associative arrays with iteration (the order is randomized in Go)
- Reading list of items from KVS table (the order is not guaranteed).  Use ordering
- Writing thread-unsafe chaincode where invoke and query may be called in parallel
- Substituting global memory or cache storage for ledger state variables in the chaincode
- Accessing external services (e.g. databases) directly from the chaincode
- Using libraries or globabl variables that could introduce non-determinism (e.g. "random" or "time")
- For templates of deterministic and properly-written chaincode, see the [examples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/v0.6/examples/chaincode) library.  This directory contains samples written in Go and Java.

__7.__ Fabric Starter Kit - This section describes how to set up a self-contained
environment for application development with the Hyperledger fabric. The setup
uses **Docker** to provide a controlled environment with all the necessary
Hyperledger fabric components to support a Node.js application built with
the fabric's Node.js SDK, and chaincode written in Go.

There are three Docker images that, when run, will provide a basic
network environment. There is an image to run a single `peer`, one to run
the `membersrvc`, and one to run both your Node.js application and your
chaincode.

__8.__ [Fabric boilerplate](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/fabric-boilerplate) -
The public IBM-Blockchain repo now contains a boilerplate application to help
application developers quickly create a network and deploy and app.  The network
can be spun up locally using Docker containers or through a Bluemix instance of
the blockchain service.  

__9.__ Fabric v0.6 provides the ability to dynamically register and enroll users
with attributes through the hfc SDK.
See [asset-mgmt-with-dynamic-roles.js](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v0.6/sdk/node/test/unit/asset-mgmt-with-dynamic-roles.js)
as an example.  The hfc SDK previously allowed you to dynamically enroll users,
but these users were already registered and aligned with attributes/affiliations
hardcoded in the membersrvc.yml.  Now a user with `registrar` authority can
register and enroll unique users to the network.  See the following code snippets
as an example of dynamic registration:

```js
// call the registerAndEnroll function to add a unique user to the network
// (i.e. a user not present in the membersrvc.yml)
// below we see "assigner2" being registered and enrolled with two unique
// attributes - a 'role' with the value of 'client' and an 'account' with the
// value of 'aliceAccount'
console.log("enrolling alice2 ...");
registerAndEnroll("alice2",[{name:'role',value:'client'},{name:'account',value:aliceAccount}], function(err,user) {
  if (err) return cb(err);
  alice = user;
```

```js
// define the funtion
function registerAndEnroll(name, attrs, cb) {
    console.log("registerAndEnroll name=%s attrs=%j",name,attrs);
    var registrationRequest = {
         roles: [ 'client' ],
         enrollmentID: name,
         affiliation: "bank_a",
         attributes: attrs
    };
    chain.registerAndEnroll(registrationRequest,cb);
}
```
