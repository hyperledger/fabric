2. A deadlock in SmartBFT caused by a view change concurrent to a block commit [is now fixed](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/5212), thanks to [@pfi79](https://github.com/pfi79).

* CouchDB v3.4.2

Fabric docker images on docker.io and ghcr.io utilize Ubuntu 24.04.


Changes and Removals
--------------------

See the [v3.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v3.0.0) for changes and removals between Fabric v2.x and Fabric v3.x.


Deprecated features
-------------------

**Block dissemination via gossip is deprecated and may be removed**

Block dissemination via gossip is deprecated and may be removed in a future release.
Fabric peers can be configured to receive blocks directly from an ordering service
node, and not gossip blocks, by using the following configuration:
```
peer.gossip.orgLeader: true
peer.gossip.useLeaderElection: false
peer.gossip.state.enabled: false
peer.deliveryclient.blockGossipEnabled: false
```
