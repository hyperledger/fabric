v1.3.0 Release Notes - October 10, 2018
---------------------------------------

What's New in Hyperledger Fabric v1.3
-------------------------------------

The following features/epics are included in this release:

FAB-10120 - Identity Mixer for anonymous transactions
Keep client identities anonymous and unlinkable through the use of
zero-knowledge proofs.

FAB-8812 - State-based endorsement
Allows the default chaincode-level endorsement policy to be overridden by a
per-key endorsement policy.

FAB-2809 - Chaincode pagination of query results
Clients can now page through result sets from chaincode queries, making it
feasible to support large result sets with high performance.

FAB-8779 - Java chaincode support
As an addition to the current Fabric support for chaincode written in Go and
Node.js, Java is now supported.


Changes, Known Issues, and Workarounds
--------------------------------------

FAB-11122 - Removal of event hub

The 'old' event hub has been removed in Hyperledger Fabric v1.3.  It is
replaced by the peer channel-based event service which was introduced in
Fabric v1.1.
Applications using the old event hub must switch over to the new
channel-based event service before upgrading to v1.3 peer or SDKs.


FAB-12088 - Java chaincode support on s390 architecture

Java chaincode support is not yet available on s390 architecture.


FAB-12134 Same chaincode source receiving fingerprint mismatch error

Chaincode installed in different ways may result in "chaincode fingerprint
mismatch data mismatch" error upon instantiation.  This may happen when
installing chaincode by using different SDKs. To workaround the problem,
package the chaincode prior to installation and instantiation, by using
the "peer chaincode package" command.


Known Vulnerabilities
---------------------
FAB-8664 - Peer should detect and react when its org has been removed
This is a relatively low severity problem, because it requires a significant
conspiracy of network admins, but it will be addressed in a future release.


Resolved Vulnerabilities
------------------------
None.


Other improvements and fixes
----------------------------
Updated to Go version 1.10.4
Updated baseimage version to 0.4.13
