This project is an _Active_ Hyperledger project. For more information on the history of this project see the [Fabric wiki page](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric). Information on what _Active_ entails can be found in
the [Hyperledger Project Lifecycle document](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Project+Lifecycle).
Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions, underpinned
by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality,
resiliency, flexibility and scalability. It is designed to support pluggable
implementations of different components, and accommodate the complexity and
intricacies that exist across the economic ecosystem.

Hyperledger Fabric delivers a uniquely elastic and extensible architecture,
distinguishing it from alternative blockchain solutions. Planning for the
future of enterprise blockchain requires building on top of a fully-vetted,
open source architecture; Hyperledger Fabric is your starting point.

## Releases

Fabric provides a release approximately once every four months with new features
and improvements. Additionally, certain releases are designated as long-term
support (LTS) releases. Important fixes will be backported to the most recent
LTS release, and to the prior LTS release during periods of LTS release overlap.
For more details see the [LTS strategy](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/blob/master/text/0005-lts-release-strategy.md).

LTS releases:
- [v2.2.x](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/whatsnew.html) (current LTS release)
- [v1.4.x](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatsnew.html) (prior LTS release, maintained through April 2021)

Unless specified otherwise, all releases will be upgradable from the prior minor release.
Additionally, each LTS release is upgradable to the next LTS release.

Fabric releases and release notes can be found on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases).

Please visit the [Hyperledger Fabric Jira dashboard](https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104) for our release roadmap.
