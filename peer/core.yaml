logging:

    # Default logging levels are specified here for each of the three peer
    # commands 'node', 'network' and 'chaincode'. For commands that have
    # subcommands, the defaults also apply to all subcommands of the command.
    # Valid logging levels are case-insensitive strings chosen from

    #     CRITICAL | ERROR | WARNING | NOTICE | INFO | DEBUG

    # The logging levels specified here can be overridden in various ways,
    # listed below from strongest to weakest:
    #
    # 1. The --logging-level=<level> command line option overrides all other
    #    specifications.
    #
    # 2. The environment variable CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL otherwise applies to
    #    all peer commands if defined as a non-empty string.
    #
    # 3. The environment variables CORE_LOGGING_[NODE|NETWORK|CHAINCODE]
    #    otherwise apply to the respective peer commands if defined as non-empty
    #    strings.
    #
    # 4. Otherwise, the specifications below apply.
